### Abstract
The need to find more efficient ways to share and use wireless spectrum
has resulted in renewed interest in radio frequency (RF) propagation modeling.
The open and programmable nature of the POWDER (Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven 
Experimental Research) mobile and wireless platform offers a unique
environment in which to test and validate RF propagation modeling approaches. 
In this paper we present our work illustrating how POWDER based RF measurements
can be performed, as a form of "ground truth", and compared with predicted
RF signal strength based on a propagation model. 
We make use
of the Shout RF measurement framework available on POWDER to perform
a series of RF measurements. We compare these measurements with predicted 
power levels using the open source RF Signal Propagation, Loss, And
Terrain (SPLAT!) analysis tool. 
We present our results and a brief
terrain analysis to provide real-world context for it. Our work is "packaged" 
as a POWDER profile to allow others to repeat our analysis and to serve
as a starting point for further RF measurement and propagation related research.
